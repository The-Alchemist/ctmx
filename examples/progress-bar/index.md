## Progress Bar

This example shows how to implement a smoothly scrolling progress bar.
We start with an intial state with a button that issues a **POST** to **start** to begin the job:

{% include snippets/progress_bar0.md %}

{% include examples/progress_bar_handler.html %}
{% include footer.html %}
{% include outer.html %}
